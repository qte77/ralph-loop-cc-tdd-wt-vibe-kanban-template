# Ralph Loop - Iteration Prompt

You are executing a single story from the Ralph autonomous development loop.

## CRITICAL: Separate Git Commits Per Phase

You MUST make **separate git commits** for each workflow phase. This is
verified automatically — the Ralph loop will **reject your work and reset
everything** if commits are missing or bundled.

**Required commits (minimum 2):**

1. `git add tests/ && git commit -m "test(STORY-XXX): ... [RED]"` — after writing failing tests
2. `git add src/ && git commit -m "feat(STORY-XXX): ... [GREEN]"` — after passing implementation
3. `git add . && git commit -m "refactor(STORY-XXX): ... [REFACTOR]"` — after cleanup (optional)

**DO NOT** bundle all work into a single commit.
**DO NOT** skip commits and describe what you "would have committed."
**DO NOT** ask for git permission — you already have it.

## Critical Rules (Apply FIRST)

- **MANDATORY**: Read and follow project compliance requirements
- **One story only**: Complete the current story, don't start others
- **Atomic changes**: Keep changes focused and minimal
- **Quality first**: All changes must pass `make validate`
- **No scope creep**: Implement exactly what the story requires
- **Status updates**: Output a one-line status message at each step
  marked with **STATUS** below

## Available Skills

Relevant skills for story implementation (others may also be available):

- `testing-python` — Test writing (TDD/BDD)
- `implementing-python` — Code implementation
- `designing-backend` — Architecture decisions
- `reviewing-code` — Self-review before completion

Use skills appropriately based on task requirements.

## Your Task

Follow the project's testing best practices. Tests MUST be written and
**committed** FIRST.

## Workflow

### Before starting: Read relevant files

- Read ALL files listed in the story's `files` array from prd.json
- Understand existing patterns before writing any code
- **STATUS**: Output "Reading story files for STORY-XXX"

### Before RED: Impact scan for renames and behavior changes

- If your story renames a function, tool, class, or changes observable
  output (HTML, colors, widget types), grep the full test tree for the
  old value: `grep -r "old_name" tests/`
- Any test file that asserts on the old value is in scope for your story,
  even if not listed in the PRD `files` array
- Update those tests alongside your implementation
- **STATUS**: Output "Impact scan: N additional test file(s) in scope" or
  "Impact scan: no cross-references found"

### RED: Write failing tests

- **STATUS**: Output "Starting RED phase: writing tests for ..."
- Read story acceptance criteria, write FAILING tests
  - Run tests — they MUST fail (code doesn't exist yet)
  - **STATUS**: Output "RED tests failing as expected. Committing."
  - **STOP AND COMMIT NOW**:
    `git add tests/ && git commit -m "test(STORY-XXX): add failing tests [RED]"`
  - Do NOT proceed to GREEN until this commit is made

### GREEN: Minimal implementation

- **STATUS**: Output "Starting GREEN phase: implementing ..."
- Implement MINIMAL code to pass tests
  - Run tests — they MUST pass now
  - **STATUS**: Output "Tests passing. Committing GREEN."
  - **STOP AND COMMIT NOW**:
    `git add src/ && git commit -m "feat(STORY-XXX): implement to pass tests [GREEN]"`
  - Do NOT proceed to REFACTOR until this commit is made

### REFACTOR: Fix remaining issues and clean up

- **STATUS**: Output "Starting REFACTOR phase"
- Fix any remaining test failures or edge cases from GREEN phase
- Improve code structure while keeping tests passing
  - Use focused checks: `make ruff`, `make type_check`,
    `make complexity`, `uv run pytest <test-file>`
  - Do NOT run `make validate` — Ralph handles full validation after
    your work
  - **COMMIT**:
    `git add . && git commit -m "refactor(STORY-XXX): fix edge cases [REFACTOR]"`

**CRITICAL**: The Ralph loop counts your commits and checks for `[RED]`
and `[GREEN]` markers. If these commits are missing, ALL your work will
be reset and you must start over.

**Retry after quality failure**: If Ralph retries your story after quality
checks failed, your prior `[RED]` and `[GREEN]` commits still exist. You
only need a `[REFACTOR]` commit to fix the remaining issues — do NOT
recreate `[RED]` or `[GREEN]`. Check git log to confirm they exist before
deciding your approach. **The `[REFACTOR]` marker in square brackets is
REQUIRED in the commit message:**
`git commit -m "refactor(STORY-XXX): fix quality issue [REFACTOR]"`

## Quality Gates

Ralph runs quality checks automatically after your work completes.
Use focused checks during development to catch issues early:

```bash
make ruff          # Format and lint src
make type_check    # Static type checking
make complexity    # Cognitive complexity check
uv run pytest <test-file>  # Run specific tests
```

Do NOT run `make validate` — it lints all test files including
pre-existing issues outside your story scope. Ralph's validation is
story-scoped.

**Note on pre-existing test failures:** The Ralph loop captures a
baseline of failing tests before your story starts. Pre-existing
failures unrelated to your story are handled by the baseline comparison
and will not block your progress. Focus only on making YOUR story's
tests pass. Do not attempt to fix unrelated failing tests.

## Reminder: Commit Discipline

Your work is verified by checking git history. Before finishing, confirm:

- [ ] `[RED]` commit exists (tests committed before implementation)
- [ ] `[GREEN]` commit exists (implementation committed after tests pass)
- [ ] Commits are separate (not bundled into one)
